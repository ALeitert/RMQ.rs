# Range Minimum Query - Rust

This is an incomplete reimplementation my [RMQ](https://github.com/ALeitert/RMQ) repository in Rust.

So far I tried to do a 1:1 implementation of previous structure in Rust.
However, this leads to a few problems and is partially the reason not everything is implemented yet.

I think what would be needed is a restructuring that fits to the restrictions Rust is giving.
